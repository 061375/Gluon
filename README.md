## About

This is meant to be a simple project for my own learning purposes, but I think its kind of a neat solution for very light-weight personal blog. The CMS is unique in that the CMS actually runs on a local server and changes are uploaded post render. The ide being tjhat since there is very little need for logic, but it would still be nice to manage content.
